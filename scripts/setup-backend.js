The first law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. The second law defines the relationship between acceleration, mass, and force: F = ma. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
