# Pre-Review Platform Analysis Todo

## Phase 1: Clone and analyze repository structure ✅
- [x] Clone repository from GitHub
- [x] Explore directory structure
- [x] Read package.json to understand dependencies
- [x] Read README.md to understand project purpose
- [x] Analyze main page component (page.tsx)
- [x] Analyze layout and navigation structure

## Phase 2: Understand website architecture and current functionality ✅
- [x] Explore components directory structure
- [x] Analyze key UI components (navigation, footer)
- [x] Review API routes and functionality (analysis/start route with Weaviate integration)
- [x] Check other page components (submit, knowledge-base)
- [x] Identify missing pages (theory-lab, theory-bootloader not implemented yet)

### Key Findings:
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive Radix UI component library in components/ui/
- **Backend**: Uses Weaviate vector database for research papers and knowledge base
- **AI Integration**: AgentOrchestrator service for multi-agent analysis
- **All Features Implemented**: All pages referenced in navigation are fully functional
- **File Upload**: Submit page has drag-and-drop functionality for paper uploads
- **Knowledge Base**: Advanced search with filtering by domain, difficulty, content type

## Phase 3: Test current website locally ✅
- [x] Install dependencies (npm install)
- [x] Run development server (npm run dev on localhost:3000)
- [x] Test all main pages and functionality
- [x] Document current user experience

### Testing Results:
- **Homepage**: ✅ Loads perfectly with hero section, feature showcase, and call-to-action buttons
- **Knowledge Base**: ✅ Fully functional with search interface and domain filtering
- **Theory Lab**: ✅ Implemented with AI agents and chat interface (contrary to initial analysis)
- **Theory Bootloader**: ✅ Implemented with multiple input methods (text, voice, file, sketch)
- **Submit Paper**: ✅ Working drag-and-drop file upload interface
- **Navigation**: ✅ All main navigation links work properly
- **Responsive Design**: ✅ Layout adapts well to different screen sizes

### Current User Experience:
- Clean, modern design with consistent branding
- Intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- Professional color scheme (blues, purples, greens)
- All major features are functional and well-designed
- Good accessibility with proper contrast and interactive elements

## Phase 4: Discuss changes with user and implement modifications
- [x] Present current analysis to user
- [ ] Discuss desired changes and improvements
- [ ] Implement requested modifications
- [ ] Test changes and deploy if needed

## Current Understanding:
- **Project Type**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Purpose**: AI-powered physics research assistant platform
- **Key Features**: 
  - Pre-review analysis of research papers
  - Theory Bootloader for concept development
  - Theory Lab for interactive AI conversations
  - Knowledge Base with 115,000+ physics knowledge chunks
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with custom styling
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI SDK for AI functionality
- **Navigation**: Comprehensive navigation with main, secondary, and admin sections
