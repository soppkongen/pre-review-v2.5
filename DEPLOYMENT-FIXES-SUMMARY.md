# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
The analysis functionality was failing on the deployed pre-review.com website with a 500 server error. The API endpoints were returning "Analysis failed" errors when users tried to submit papers for review.

## Root Cause
Missing import statements in API route files. The Next.js API routes were missing the required imports for `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` from 'next/server', causing runtime errors in the production environment.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/app/api/analysis/start/route.ts`
**Problem**: Missing `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` imports
**Fix**: Added `import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'`

### 2. `/app/api/theory-lab/chat/route.ts`
**Problem**: Missing `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` imports  
**Fix**: Added `import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'`

## Testing Results
- ✅ Local testing confirmed API endpoints now work correctly
- ✅ Analysis API returns 200 OK status with complete analysis results
- ✅ All import statements are properly resolved
- ✅ No compilation errors or runtime issues

## Deployment Impact
These fixes resolve the 500 server errors that were preventing:
- Paper submission and analysis functionality
- Theory Lab chat functionality
- Overall user experience on the deployed site

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the fixed version to pre-review.com
2. Test the live functionality
3. Verify all API endpoints work correctly in production

## Technical Details
The issue occurred because Next.js API routes require explicit imports for request/response types in production builds, even though they may work in development mode without them. This is a common deployment gotcha when moving from development to production environments.
