# Pre-Review Website Redesign & Simplification

## User Requirements:
- **Simplify site structure**: Reduce to 4 main pages (Homepage, Review Paper, Theory Lab, About/FAQ)
- **Combine features**: Merge Theory Bootloader + Theory Lab into single page with chat interface and file upload
- **Minimalistic design**: Clean, professional look like original prev.t-pip.no site
- **Color scheme**: Adopt teal/green color scheme from original site (#1f7a7a)
- **Focus**: Emphasize interactive development of research theories for pre-review preparation

## New Site Structure:
1. **Homepage** - Clean hero section with clear value proposition
2. **Review Paper** - Upload and analysis functionality (keep current submit features)
3. **Theory Lab** - Combined chat interface + file upload for interactive theory development
4. **About/FAQ** - Simple informational pages
